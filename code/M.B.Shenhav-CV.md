## Experience

-------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
\

*2015-2017:*               **Chief Organizer & Founder**

                              *Fluxcraft Econetwork*

                              --------------------

                              Designing and implementing a new kind of hybrid organization devoted to operating open infrastructure in symbiosis with sustainable ecosystems; this is my long term project, but is currently on the backburner.

\

*2004-2017:*               **Freelance Graphic, Web & Brand Design**

                              *The Netherlands, Sweden & Finland*

                              --------------------

                              Produced logos, posters, catalogues and basic websites for various clients. Later on developed a knack for branding and copywriting. Currently interested in programming automated typesetting and infographics systems.
                              
                              

\

*2014-2015:*                  **Mathematical & Computational Ecology Researcher**

                              *University of Helsinki*

                              *Metapopulation Research Center & Integrative Ecology Unit*

                              *supervised by Lasse Ruokolainen & Veijo Kaitala*.

                              --------------------
                              
                              Developed a stochastic simulation framework for metacommunities - spatiotemporally distributed ecosystems. The idea was to allow to investigate the influence of spatiotemporally correlated noise on distributed dynamical systems.

\

*2010-2017:*               **Private Tutor in Mathematical Science**

					          *Vienna, Hilversum & Helsinki* 

                              --------------------
                              
                              Focused on IBO Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Curriculum. Now interested in developing interactive and methodologically geared learning platforms through my Fluxcraft project.

\

*2009-2013:*                  **Masters Degree in Biomathematics**

                              *University of Vienna, Austria*

                              --------------------
                              
                              With a focus on stochastic processes in complex biological and social systems, I specialized on developing (anti)fragility and multiscale analytics and metrics on networks. It is here I took a deep interest on the role of randomness and behavior in biological and sociocultural ecology and evolution.
                              
\

*2005-2009:*                **Bachelors Degrees in Physics and Mathematics**

                              *University of Utrecht, the Netherlands*

                              --------------------
                              
                              Began with an interest in physics until I fell in-love with the life science, in particular with applying evolutionary game theory to epistemological problems. The bachelors thesis got me into network theory.

\

*2003-2005:*                **IB Diploma Program**

                              *International School Hilversum, the Netherlands*

                              --------------------

                              Studied a curriculum of higher-level physics, chemistry and mathematics in and standard-level economics, english A1 and dutch A2. Developed a taste for philosophy and methodology in theory of knowledge and science classes.
