# Fluxcraft Econetwork

This document outlines a proposal for the *Fluxcraft Econetwork*: a hybrid organization devoted to providing *open infrastructure* for facilitating *sustainable ecosystems*. It would do so by designing and implementing a *global platform* for cooperation, technical collaboration and social networking and *local stations* that provide a public space for coworking, recreation and civil debate. With the aid of these, we would create new kinds of *scalable institutions* called *Ecoventure Incubators* which balance the needs and interests of citizens, laborers and investors in promoting environmentally, socially and technically sustainable ventures.
